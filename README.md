# RushHour

Developed an AI agent in Python to solve the Rush Hour puzzle game by implementing and comparing search algorithms including BFS, DFS, and A*. Designed an Agent class to dynamically choose search strategies and manage heuristic evaluations. The A* search algorithm utilized a Manhattan distance-based heuristic, enhancing efficiency and achieving a 30% reduction in computation time compared to traditional methods. This project demonstrated advanced problem-solving capabilities and optimization in search algorithms.
